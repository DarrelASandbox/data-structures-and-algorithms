## Instructions

- The runtime reflected in the solutions is inaccurate. You are better off with asymptotic analysis (Big-O Notation).
- Refer to the respective link to leetcode website to get the full problem information including constraint, diagram, etc.
- Use [Pastebin](https://pastebin.com/) to code before copy and paste the code into compare.txt file to check the difference between your code and the solution.

## Patterns

1. Sliding Window
2. Two Pointers or Iterators
3. Fast and Slow pointers
4. Merge Intervals
5. Cyclic sort
6. In-place reversal of linked list
7. Tree Breadth First Search (BFS)
8. Tree Depth First Search (DFS)
9. Two heaps
