# Symbol Tables

## API

```java
ST<String, Integer> st = new ST<String, Integer>();
st.put("Hello", 12);
st.put("World", 21);
st.put("Hello", 49);
```

- Which value is associated with the key HelloHello after executing the following code fragment:
  - 12
  - 49
  - Both 12 and 49
  - Either 12 or 49, depending on the implementation
  - Ans: 2
    - The ST API specifies that `put()` overwrites the old value with the new value when called on a key already in the symbol table.

## Elementary Implementations

- What is the maximum number of array accesses needed to search for a key in a symbol table that is implemented with a sorted array?
  - constant
  - logarithmic
  - linear
  - linearithmic
  - Ans: 2
    - Use binary search

## Ordered Operations

- What is the maximum number of compares to determine the rank of a key in a symbol table that is implemented using a sorted array?
  - constant
  - logarithmic
  - linear
  - linearithmic
  - Ans: 2
    - Use binary search

# Binary Search Trees

## BSTs

- Suppose that nn distinct keys are inserted into a binary search tree in random order. What is the expected number of compares to search for one of the nn keys?
  - constant
  - logarithmic
  - linear
  - linearithmic
  - Ans: 2

## Ordered Operations

```
        R
      /   \
     /     \
    E       X
   / \     /
  C   M   S
 /   / \
A   H   P
```

- A BST is uniquely defined by its level-order traversal, a breadth-first traversal where the root is visited first, then all nodes at depth 1 (going from left to right), then all nodes at depth 2 (going from left to right), and so forth. What is the level-order traversal of the BST drawn below?
  - A C E H M P R S X
  - A C H P M E S X R
    - This is the postorder traversal. The root node (R) is always the first node visited in a level-order traversal.
  - R E C A M H P X S
    - This is the preorder traversal.
  - R E X C M S A H P
  - Ans: 4
    - To code up a level-order traversal, you would use a queue instead of a (function-call) stack.

## Deletion

- What is the order of growth of the expected height of a binary search tree with nn keys after a long intermixed sequence of random insertions and random Hibbard deletions?
  - $\log n$
  - $\sqrt{n}$
  - $n$
  - $n\log n$
  - Ans: 2
    - The main defect of Hibbard deletion is that it unbalances the tree, leading to $\sqrt{n}$â€‹ height.
    - If instead of replacing the node to delete with its successor, you flip a coin and replace it with either its successor or predecessor, then, in practice, the height becomes logarithmic (but nobody has been able to prove this fact mathematically).
